# 🧮 Unit Converter - **Because Math Is Hard™** - Powered By chickenSandwich!!!!🔥🐤🥪🔥

## 🤔 About This Project  
Welcome to the **Unit Converter**, the tool that helps you avoid **❌embarrassing math mistakes❌** when trying to convert things manually. Because let's be honest🤔, **nobody actually remembers😅** how much Celcius is 100 Kelvin without looking it up🤡  

## 🔄 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Pick a category** (Temperature, Time, Speed, etc.), more in future updates!👻

2️⃣ **Enter your value** (like 100 Fahrenheit because you’re suffering in a heatwave🌞).  

3️⃣ **Instantly🤯 get the converted unit** without crying😢 over formulas.  

4️⃣ **Profit📈** (not really, but at least you won’t mess up metric vs. imperial anymore😏😏).  

## 🔥 Features  
✔ **Accurate😏 conversions** (probably😅).

✔ **Handles multiple unit types😦** so you **never🫨** have to Google “how much 60 mph would be in kmh?🤔” again.

✔ **Lightning-fast⚡⚡ calculations** because **your brain🧠 deserves a break🧊**.

✔ **Can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit faster than your AC can save you🤪🤪**

## 📌 Future Upgrades?  
❓ **Adding➕➕ more obscure units?** (Like measuring distance in sandwiches🥪🤔).

❓ **Building🧱 a GUI?** (If (demand ≥ supply)) {};

❓ **Making the UI look cooler🥶?** (To distract from math-induced pain💦🩹).
